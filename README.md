# My-First-Repository
My first step into web development — a simple project built from scratch.<br>
This is my first web development project, created while learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It’s a simple beginner-friendly project to practice structuring a webpage, styling it, and adding basic interactivity.
